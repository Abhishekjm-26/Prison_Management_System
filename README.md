# Prison_Management_System
This project is aimed at developing a prison management system that is a collection of registers and reports for the effective management of prisons. Basically prison is a correctional institution where persons are confined while on trial or for punishment. Each prison may have hundreds of criminals. With hardcopy of records it is hard to search report or record about a particular criminal in prison. The purpose of this document is to present a detailed description of the Prison Management System. The document will describe what to do, the constraints under which it must operate and how the system will react to external stimuli. This software will be a Prison Management System for Prison Department. This system will be efficient collection of records and reports about the prisoners in prison. Besides police officers and higher government authorities can see reports about prisoners easily. The public can search for their relatives or friends who are imprisoned for lawful detention, about the crime, place where they imprisoned or release date of imprisoned person.
